<h1>The Team</h1>


		<p class="dropcap">
		So here we are. Dominic, Patrick and Vicki make up Rolling Anomaly. We're a fun loving bunch, always up for a laugh and a bit of a mission.
                </p>

		<p class="main">
		Why Rolling Anomaly? The astute amongst you will have noticed that if you re-arrange our our name you get "Mongolian Rally", not quite Mongol Rally but as close as damn it! It took hours of deliberation and many many emails to come up with the name as it should. After all we do have to stick with it all the way to Mongolia!!
