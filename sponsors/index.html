		Sohonet employ Patrick as a Network Engineer. Sohonet create network solutions for media companies which involves moving large amounts of data around the world reliably at very high speeds. Quite ironic that sending one of their employees to Mongolia in an Allegro could be one of the slowest and least reliable ways to do that work! Thank you to everyone for their support and to the Directors for a very generous charity donation.<BR><BR>

		Having met with some of the members and people who run the Allegro Club we are now a lot better equipped with spare parts and the knowledge of what the weak points of the car are. Thank you to all the Club Members who donated when we brought the car up to Birmingham for the Allegro 35th birthday.
